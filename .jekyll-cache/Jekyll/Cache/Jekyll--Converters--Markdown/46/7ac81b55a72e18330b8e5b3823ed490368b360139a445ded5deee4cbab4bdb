<p>Registration for FACS 2023 will be free but mandatory. Information on how to register will be presented later.</p>

<h1 id="scope">Scope</h1>

<p>FACS 2023 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to component-based software and system development. Formal methods have provided foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and certification. Furthermore, we embrace a trend in recent FACS editions by introducing a new special track of ‚ÄúFormal Methods at Large‚Äù: it will accept submissions about advances based on formal methods across all kinds of software-intensive systems, possibly unrelated to components or composition.</p>

<h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>

<p>The conference seeks to address the applications of formal methods in all aspects of software components and services. FACS aims at developing a community-based understanding of relevant and emerging research problems through formal paper presentations and lively discussions. FACS 2023 welcomes contributions including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formal methods, models, and languages for software-intensive systems, components and services, including
    <ul>
      <li>verification techniques (e.g., model checking, type systems, testing, runtime analysis),</li>
      <li>probabilistic techniques,</li>
      <li>(co-)simulation techniques,</li>
      <li>composition and deployment,</li>
      <li>component interaction,</li>
      <li>software variability,</li>
      <li>QoS and other non-functional properties (e.g., trust, compliance, security, privacy);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Formal aspects of concrete software-intensive systems, including
    <ul>
      <li>service-oriented architectures,</li>
      <li>business processes,</li>
      <li>cloud or edge computing,</li>
      <li>real-time/safety-critical systems,</li>
      <li>hybrid and cyber physical systems,</li>
      <li>quantum systems,</li>
      <li>components that use artificial intelligence;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tools supporting formal methods for components and services;</li>
  <li>Case studies and experience reports over the above topics;</li>
  <li>Special track: Formal Methods at Large.</li>
</ul>

<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of FACS, we also invite submissions on the topic of ‚Äúcomponent-based systems through the years‚Äù that describe important results and successful stories that originated in the context of component-based software engineering. All the accepted papers will be presented in a special session.</p>

<h1 id="submissions">Submissions</h1>

<p>We solicit high-quality submissions reporting on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A</strong> - full papers: original research, applications and experiences, or surveys 
(16 pages);</li>
  <li><strong>B</strong> - short papers: tools and demonstrations (6 pages);</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong> - journal-first papers (4 pages).</li>
</ul>

<!-- Accepted papers from all categories will appear in the proceedings of the
conference. -->
<p>Accepted papers from all categories will be published by Springer, in the Lecture Notes for Computer Science series. The page limit excludes references and appendices. Papers should be prepared in LaTeX, adhering to the Springer LNCS format and Guidelines. For further information please visit the LNCS page at <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs" target="_blank">https://www.springer.com/lncs</a>.</p>

<p>Please use the easychair link below to submit your paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs2023" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs2023</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers to a special issue of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming" target="_blank">Science of Computer Programming</a>.</p>

<h3 id="full-and-toolshort-publications-a-b">Full and tool/short publications (A, B)</h3>

<p>All submissions in categories <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> must be original, unpublished,
and not submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. A special journal
issue is planned for extended versions of selected papers from categories A
and B from FACS 2023.</p>

<h3 id="journal-first-publications-c">Journal-first publications (C)</h3>

<p>Submissions in category <strong>C</strong> must be 4-page abstracts of journal papers published after January 1st, 2023. Authors of published papers in high-quality journals can submit a proposal to present their journal paper at FACS. The journal paper must adhere to the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is clearly in the scope of FACS.</li>
  <li>It is recent: only journal papers available after January 1st, 2023 (online or printed) can be presented.</li>
  <li>It reports new research results that significantly extend prior work. As such, the journal paper does not simply extend prior work with material presented for completeness only (such as omitted proofs, algorithms, minor enhancements, or empirical results).</li>
  <li>It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other similar conferences or workshops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Journal-first submissions must be marked as such in EasyChair, and they must explicitly include pointers to the journal publication (such as a DOI).</p>
