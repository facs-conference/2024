# Scope

FACS 2024 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to component-based software and system development. Formal methods have provided foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and certification.

# Topics

The conference seeks to address the applications of formal methods in all aspects of software components and services. FACS aims at developing a community-based understanding of relevant and emerging research problems through formal paper presentations and lively discussions. FACS 2024 welcomes contributions including but not limited to:

  - Formal methods, models, and languages for software-intensive systems, components and services, including
    + verification techniques (e.g., model checking, type systems, testing, runtime analysis),
    + probabilistic techniques,
    + (co-)simulation techniques,
    + composition and deployment,
    + component interaction,
    + software variability,
    + QoS and other non-functional properties (e.g., trust, compliance, security, privacy);
  - Formal aspects of concrete software-intensive systems, including
    + service-oriented architectures,
    + business processes,
    + cloud or edge computing,
    + real-time/safety-critical systems,
    + hybrid and cyber physical systems,
    + quantum systems,
    + components that use artificial intelligence;
  - Tools supporting formal methods for components and services;
  - Case studies and experience reports over the above topics;

# Special Track

FACS 2024 will feature a special track on "Formal Methods of Component Software in the context of emerging computational paradigms‚Äù. Examples of such emerging computational paradigms include but are not limited to:

- cyber physical human systems
- quantum computations
- AI systems
- blockchain systems
