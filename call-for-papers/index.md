# Overview

FACS 2024 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to component-
based software and system development. Formal methods have provided
foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical
models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches
to verification, deployment, testing, and certification.

# Topics

The conference seeks to address the applications of formal methods in all
aspects of software components and services. FACS aims at developing a
community-based understanding of relevant and emerging research problems
through formal paper presentations and lively discussions. FACS 2024
welcomes contributions including but not limited to:

- Formal methods, models, and languages for software-intensive systems,
  components and services, including verification techniques (e.g., model
  checking, theorem proving, testing, constraint solving, runtime analysis),
  probabilistic techniques, (co-)simulation techniques, composition and
  deployment, component interaction, software variability, QoS and other
  nonfunctional properties (e.g., trust, compliance, security, privacy);
- Formal aspects of concrete software-intensive systems, including service-
  oriented architectures, business processes, cloud or edge computing, real-
  time/safety-critical systems, hybrid and cyber physical systems, quantum
  systems, components that use artificial intelligence;
- Tools supporting formal methods for components and services;
- Case studies and experience reports over the above topics;
- **Special track: Formal Methods of Component Software in the context of
  emerging computational paradigms** (e.g. cyber physical human systems,
  quantum computations, AI systems, blockchain systems, etc) .

# Submission and Publication
 
We solicit high-quality submissions reporting on:

- (A) full papers: original research, applications and experiences, or
	surveys (16 pages);
- (B) short papers: tools and demonstrations (6 pages);
- (C) Special track papers (16 pages);

The page limit excludes references and appendices. Papers should be prepared
in LaTeX, adhering to the Springer LNCS format and Guidelines. Papers should
be submitted through the easychair link:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs2024)

All submitted papers should be in LNCS format and unpublished and not
submitted for publication elsewhere. All accepted papers will have to be
presented at the conference by one of their authors. Accepted papers in
all categories will be published in the FACS proceedings and published
as a volume in Springer LNCS series.

The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to
submit an extended version of their papers to a special issue of the Science
of Computer Programming journal.
