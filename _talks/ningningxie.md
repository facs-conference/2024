Program generation is a powerful and expressive approach to eliminating abstraction
overhead and improving program performance, which has been studied
and implemented in a variety of languages with different forms.
In this talk we overview MacoCaml, a new design and implementation of
compile-time computation for OCaml. MacoCaml features a unifying and novel
combination of phase separation and quotation-based staging. We review Maco-
Camlâ€™s recent developments, including a comprehensive formalism of a featurerich
macro calculus with key meta-theoretic properties, and an extension to
module functors that leads to explicit phase distinction. We describe how the
meta-theoretical results offer practical benefits for programmers, and conclude
the talk with a few directions for future exploration.
